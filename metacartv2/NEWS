Changes in metacart Version 2.0-0 (2018-11-21)
========================================
* New plot.FEmrt() function that produces the same plots as plot.REmrt().
* New REmrt() function that implements the update scheme to boost the speed. Also, internal Rcpp functions .compute_tau_() and .compute_re_Q_() were created to speed up the computation of residual heterogeneity and Q-statistic for each split point.
* Xvalid_all() is renewed with faster speed. Internal Rcpp functions .partition(), .ComputeY(), .PredY(), .ReplaceNA() were added.
* quint.validate() is renewed.
* New example data set dat.balanced is added.
